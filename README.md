## 📊 Rating Algorithm

FlushFinder uses a sophisticated Bayesian smoothing algorithm:

```
Bayesian Rating = (total_ratings × avg_rating + prior_rating × prior_weight) / (total_ratings + prior_weight)
```

- **Prior Rating**: 3.6 (optimistic default)
- **Prior Weight**: 8 (equivalent to 8 virtual reviews)
- **Result**: More reliable ratings that prevent extreme scores
